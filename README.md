# DBMS_Resume_Management
A resume is one of the key elements for any job application. However, making one with all the necessary details could prove to be a difficult task for some. Skimming and filtering through potentially thousands of such resumes could be equally difficult for the concerned company/employer. In our project we would like to address and find a possible solution to these problems by making a resume builder/manager using a RDBMS.
